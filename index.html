                <p class="paragraph">My interest in design started in high school.  The few multimedia courses, art classes, and a web design course introduced me to the art of design.  It was ultimately the web design course that intrigued me to major in Graphic Design.  Through the courses I have completed so far, my focus leans toward web design and marketing/editorial design but am finding new areas that I am interested in.  My favorite projects to date have dealt with brand identity and editorial design.  Other projects I have done are displayed on my <a href= "https://www.behance.net/nataliewagley1">behance</a> site.</p>
    
                <p class= "paragraph">In this course, I hope to build off of basic knowledge I have of html and css.  Learning new things about design and challenging myself is something I love to do.  Looking into the future, I want to move to a bigger city and work for a company within the field of web and marketing design.  Iâ€™d love to do something with social media marketing or anything pertaining to design but would be grateful for any design opportunity given to me.</p>
